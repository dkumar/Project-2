# GitHub Command List #
#######################
*********THIS FILE IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS*********
This is a reference guide for commands that will most likely
be used to sync our files onto GitHub.  Anyone can add onto
this file, just try to keep the format uniform.

## Shell Commands ##
mkdir dirname //Create a new directory
touch filename //Create an empty file to work on
cd dir //Move to a directory
rm filename //Remove a file
rmdir dir //Remove an empty directory


## Creating a Repo  ##
** These commands should only be used to make a NEW repo. **

git init //Create a new repo in the current directory
git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git 
    //Create a new remote to add your repo onto github.

## Getting an Existing Repo ##
1. //Create a new branch on GitHub website.
2. git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git //Copy files from repo
                                                to your computer.
3. git remote add git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git //add remote to original repo

## Making and Getting Changes ##
1. git fetch upstream //Check for any updates to your files.  Always do this before you start editing.
2. git merge upstream/master //Merge conflicting upstream changes to your own version.



1. git add filename //Add a new file to the list of files to be tracked. You only need to do this for 
    		 new files.  Existing ones just need to be committed.
2. git commit  -am 'comment' //Add your changes to the repo log with a
                              comment for the change.  Be descriptive.
3. git push upstream master //Add your changes to GitHub.  Remeber to push to the upstream remote.
